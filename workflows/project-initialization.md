# Project Initialization Workflow
_Last updated: 2025-10-30_

## Goal
Get from rough project idea to ready-to-code with a validated tech stack. The IDE (Cursor/Claude Code) will then generate the PRD and handle implementation.

## Overview
This workflow prepares everything needed before opening your IDE. It's a **3-step process**:
1. Start with a project idea
2. Flesh out and validate your tech stack
3. Hand off to your coding IDE to develop the PRD

**Key Innovation**: Multi-AI validation (Step 2) catches tech stack mistakes early using free tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity) before you write any code.

**What Happens Next**: Your IDE (Cursor/Claude Code) generates the PRD, saves it to memory/project files, and starts implementation.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Start with Project Idea
**What you have**: Rough concept or project brief

**Examples**:
- "Build an AI desktop video editor"
- "Create a WhatsApp clone with AI features"
- "Make a messaging app for remote teams"

**What to gather**:
- Project specifications, rubrics, constraints
- Target user personas
- MVP scope vs. future features
- Platform/technology constraints (if any)
- Timeline and deadlines

**Output**: Clear project context with rough scope

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

---

### Step 2: Flesh Out & Validate Tech Stack (Multi-AI Consultation)
**What you do**: Research tech stack options and validate them with multiple AIs

**How**:
1. Research 2-3 potential tech stacks for your project
2. Use the [[templates/stack-validation-prompt|Stack Validation Prompt Template]]
3. Submit to 2-3 free AI tools:
   - **ChatGPT** (free tier) - General tech advice
   - **Claude.ai** (free tier) - Detailed architecture discussion
   - **Grok** (X.com) - Alternative perspectives
   - **Perplexity** - Research-backed validation
4. Compare their recommendations
5. Document consensus and concerns

**Questions they'll help you answer**:
- Which stack fits my timeline and requirements?
- What are the performance implications?
- What risks am I missing?
- Are there better alternatives?
- Is my MVP scope realistic?

**Output**:
- Validated, confident tech stack decision
- List of known risks and how to handle them
- Refined MVP scope
- Documentation of what each AI recommended

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

**Why this matters**: Catches 80% of tech stack mistakes before you write any code. Multiple AI perspectives reveal issues you'd miss alone.

---

### Step 3: Hand Off to IDE - Let it Develop the PRD
**What happens**: Open your coding IDE and let IT generate the detailed PRD

**Tools**: [[tools/cursor]] (recommended) or [[tools/claude-code]]

**Process**:
1. **Open your IDE** (Cursor or Claude Code)
2. **Create new project** or open existing folder
3. **Use PRD prompt template**:
   - **For Cursor**: [[templates/prd-prompt-template|PRD Prompt Template (Cursor)]]
   - **For Claude**: [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude|PRD Prompt Template (Claude)]]
4. **Fill in your validated details**:
   - Project name and specs
   - Validated tech stack from Step 2
   - User persona
   - MVP features
   - Risks identified
5. **Submit to IDE** - Let it generate the complete PRD
6. **Save PRD in TWO places**:
   - **IDE Memory**: Cursor's memory bank or Claude's context
   - **Project Files**: `/docs/PRD.md` in your project
7. **Review and refine** with the IDE if needed

**Output**:
- Complete, detailed PRD saved in IDE memory
- PRD document in project files (`/docs/PRD.md`)
- Ready to start coding

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

**Why this approach**:
- IDE generates PRD while having full project context
- Saves to memory for ongoing reference during development
- IDE can reference PRD throughout implementation
- PRD stays accessible in project for team collaboration

---

## After These 3 Steps

You're ready to code! Your IDE has:
- ✅ Complete PRD in memory
- ✅ Validated tech stack
- ✅ Known risks and mitigations
- ✅ Clear MVP scope

**Next**: Start building. Your IDE will reference the PRD as you work.

---

## Current Setup

This is a **3-step prep workflow** before opening your IDE:

1. **Project Idea** (Step 1): Gather context and scope
2. **Tech Stack Validation** (Step 2): Multi-AI consultation
   - [[templates/stack-validation-prompt|Stack Validation Prompt]] - for ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity
3. **IDE Handoff** (Step 3): Let IDE generate PRD
   - [[templates/prd-prompt-template|Cursor PRD Template]] - for Cursor IDE
   - [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude|Claude PRD Template]] - for Claude Code

**Key Point**: PRD is generated BY your IDE (Cursor/Claude Code) and saved in:
- IDE memory (Cursor memory bank, Claude context)
- Project files (`/docs/PRD.md`)

This keeps the PRD accessible throughout development.

## Tools Used

### Step 1: Project Idea
- Your notes, project briefs, specifications
- User research, personas
- Timeline and constraint documentation

### Step 2: Tech Stack Validation
- **ChatGPT** (free tier) - General tech advice
- **Claude.ai** (free tier) - Architectural discussion
- **Grok** (X.com) - Alternative perspectives
- **Perplexity** - Research-backed validation
- [[templates/stack-validation-prompt]] - Stack validation prompt template

### Step 3: IDE Handoff & PRD Generation
- **[[tools/cursor]]** - Recommended IDE with memory bank
- **[[tools/claude-code]]** - Alternative IDE with context storage
- [[templates/prd-prompt-template]] - Cursor-optimized PRD prompt
- [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude]] - Claude-optimized PRD prompt

**PRD Storage**:
- IDE memory (Cursor memory bank or Claude context)
- Project files: `/docs/PRD.md`

## Examples
- [[ai-drafts/chatiq-prd-example]] - WhatsApp clone with AI features for remote teams

## Problems / Pain Points
- Initial ideas are often too vague for implementation
- Tech stack decisions require deep knowledge of tradeoffs
- Easy to over-scope MVP and miss deadlines
- AI agents need very specific prompts to generate useful PRDs
- Single AI perspective can miss critical issues
- Committing to wrong stack wastes days of work

## Changes Tried
- [x] Created reusable PRD prompt template with placeholders
- [x] Structured prompt to focus on MVP vs. post-MVP features
- [x] Added explicit risk/pitfall section for tech stack decisions
- [x] Created separate Cursor-optimized and Claude-optimized templates
- [x] Added multi-AI stack validation step (Step 3) using free tools
- [ ] Test stack validation with ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity
- [ ] Test prompts with multiple project types
- [ ] Refine based on agent output quality
- [ ] Compare Cursor vs Claude PRD generation quality
- [ ] Document findings from multi-AI validation

## Next Steps
1. Use template for ChatIQ messaging app project
2. Validate PRD generation quality with Cursor
3. Document any template improvements needed
4. Create library of project examples

## Notes

> **Simple 3-step approach**: This workflow gets you from idea to ready-to-code in 40-60 minutes total. Steps 1-2 are prep work, Step 3 is letting your IDE do the heavy lifting.

> **IDE-generated PRD**: The PRD is created BY your coding IDE (Cursor/Claude Code), not by you manually. The IDE has full project context and saves it to memory for ongoing reference.

> **Key insight**: Multi-AI validation (Step 2) catches 80% of tech stack mistakes BEFORE you open your IDE. Spending 15-20 minutes here prevents days of rework.

> **Memory is critical**: Saving the PRD in your IDE's memory (Cursor memory bank, Claude context) means it's always available during development. No need to re-explain the project constantly.
