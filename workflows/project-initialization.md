# Project Initialization Workflow
_Last updated: 2025-10-30_

## Goal
Standardized process for taking a rough project idea and turning it into a clear, well-validated Product Requirements Document (PRD) with a confident tech stack decision.

## Overview
This workflow bridges the gap between "I want to build X" and "Here's exactly how to build X with Y stack." It uses a **6-step process** including multi-AI validation to ensure tech stack decisions are sound before generating a comprehensive PRD and starting development.

**Key Innovation**: Step 3 validates your tech stack and project plan across multiple free AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity) to catch mistakes early and build confidence in your decisions.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Receive Initial Idea
**Input**: Rough concept or project brief
- Example: "Build an AI desktop video editor"
- Example: "Create a WhatsApp clone with AI features"
- Can be high-level, lacking technical details

**Output**: Clear problem statement and user needs

---

### Step 2: Gather Requirements & Context
**Actions**:
1. Collect any project specifications, rubrics, or constraints
2. Identify target user personas
3. Define MVP scope vs. future features
4. Note any platform/technology constraints
5. Research potential tech stack options

**Output**: Complete project context document with 2-3 potential tech stacks

---

### Step 3: Stack Validation & Planning Discussion (Multi-AI Consultation)
**Purpose**: Validate tech stack decisions and discuss project approach with multiple AI models before committing to full PRD

**Free AI Tools to Use**:
- ChatGPT (free tier) - General tech stack advice
- Claude.ai (free tier) - Detailed architectural discussion
- Grok (X.com) - Alternative perspectives
- Perplexity - Research-backed recommendations
- Gemini - Google's perspective on tech choices

**Process**:
1. Use the [[templates/stack-validation-prompt|Stack Validation Prompt Template]]
2. Submit to 2-3 different AI models (use free tiers)
3. Compare responses and identify:
   - Common recommendations across AIs
   - Performance concerns raised
   - Pros/cons of each stack option
   - MVP scope feasibility
   - Potential pitfalls or gotchas

**What to Discuss**:
- **Tech Stack Options**: Present 2-3 potential stacks, ask for comparison
- **Performance Considerations**: Database choice, real-time sync, scaling
- **MVP Feasibility**: Can this be built in your timeline?
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong with each approach?
- **Alternative Approaches**: What did you miss? Better options?
- **Cost Implications**: Free tiers, API costs, hosting

**Output**:
- Validated tech stack decision (with confidence)
- List of confirmed risks and mitigation strategies
- Refined MVP scope based on AI feedback
- Notes on what each AI recommended

**Example Questions to Ask**:
```markdown
I'm building [PROJECT_NAME] - a [brief description].

Timeline: [MVP deadline]
Key features: [list 3-5 core features]

I'm considering these tech stacks:
1. [Stack A]: [components]
2. [Stack B]: [components]

Questions:
- Which stack is better for my timeline and requirements?
- What are the performance implications of each?
- What risks am I not seeing?
- Are there better alternatives I should consider?
- What's the realistic MVP scope with each stack?
```

**Why This Step Matters**:
- Catches tech stack mistakes early (before coding starts)
- Multiple AI perspectives reduce blind spots
- Free tools = no cost for validation
- Increases confidence in your decisions
- Often reveals simpler approaches you hadn't considered

### Step 4: Generate PRD via AI Agent
**Tool**: [[tools/cursor]] or [[tools/claude-code]]

**Choose Your Template**:
- **For Cursor**: Use [[templates/prd-prompt-template|PRD Prompt Template (Cursor)]] - concise, directive
- **For Claude**: Use [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude|PRD Prompt Template (Claude)]] - conversational, comprehensive

**Process**:
1. Choose the appropriate template for your AI agent
2. Fill in project-specific details:
   - Project name
   - Full specification
   - Chosen platform/stack
   - User persona
   - Core features
3. Submit to AI agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
4. Agent generates structured PRD

**Output**: Complete PRD with:
- User stories
- MVP feature list
- Tech stack with justifications
- Out-of-scope items
- Risk analysis

---

### Step 5: Review & Refine PRD
**Actions**:
1. Review generated PRD for accuracy
2. Cross-check with Step 3 AI feedback
3. Adjust scope if needed
4. Get stakeholder approval if applicable

**Output**: Approved, final PRD

---

### Step 6: Implementation
**Process**:
1. Start building based on your approved PRD
2. Use your chosen AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
3. Implement features incrementally
4. Test as you go
5. Deploy when MVP is complete

**Output**: Working MVP

## Current Setup (Planning Focus)
This workflow focuses on **Steps 1-5** (planning and validation). Implementation methodology is covered separately.

1. **Stack Validation Phase** (Step 3): Multi-AI consultation using free tools
   - [[templates/stack-validation-prompt|Stack Validation Prompt]] - for ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.
2. **PRD Generation** (Step 4): Two prompt templates available
   - [[templates/prd-prompt-template|Cursor-optimized]] - for Cursor IDE
   - [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude|Claude-optimized]] - for Claude Code / Claude.ai
3. Default recommendations: Firebase + React Native/Expo for rapid prototyping
4. Hybrid AI approach for AI features (dedicated assistant + contextual features)

## Tools Used

### For Stack Validation (Step 3)
- ChatGPT (free tier) - General tech advice
- Claude.ai (free tier) - Architectural discussion
- Grok (X.com) - Alternative perspectives
- Perplexity - Research-backed validation
- Gemini - Google's tech recommendations
- [[templates/stack-validation-prompt]] - Stack validation prompt template

### For PRD Generation (Step 4)
- [[tools/cursor]] - AI code editor for PRD generation
- [[tools/claude-code]] - AI agent for planning
- [[templates/prd-prompt-template]] - Cursor-optimized PRD prompt template
- [[templates/prd-prompt-template-claude]] - Claude-optimized PRD prompt template

### For Implementation (Step 6)
- [[tools/cursor]] - AI code editor
- [[tools/claude-code]] - AI coding assistant
- [[tools/firebase]] - Backend infrastructure (common choice)

## Examples
- [[ai-drafts/chatiq-prd-example]] - WhatsApp clone with AI features for remote teams

## Problems / Pain Points
- Initial ideas are often too vague for implementation
- Tech stack decisions require deep knowledge of tradeoffs
- Easy to over-scope MVP and miss deadlines
- AI agents need very specific prompts to generate useful PRDs
- Single AI perspective can miss critical issues
- Committing to wrong stack wastes days of work

## Changes Tried
- [x] Created reusable PRD prompt template with placeholders
- [x] Structured prompt to focus on MVP vs. post-MVP features
- [x] Added explicit risk/pitfall section for tech stack decisions
- [x] Created separate Cursor-optimized and Claude-optimized templates
- [x] Added multi-AI stack validation step (Step 3) using free tools
- [ ] Test stack validation with ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity
- [ ] Test prompts with multiple project types
- [ ] Refine based on agent output quality
- [ ] Compare Cursor vs Claude PRD generation quality
- [ ] Document findings from multi-AI validation

## Next Steps
1. Use template for ChatIQ messaging app project
2. Validate PRD generation quality with Cursor
3. Document any template improvements needed
4. Create library of project examples

## Notes
> This workflow focuses on thorough planning before development. The PRD should be detailed enough that implementation is straightforward and clear.

> **Key insight**: The quality of the PRD directly impacts implementation speed. Spending 30-60 minutes on a solid PRD saves hours in development.

> **Critical step - Multi-AI validation (Step 3)**: Consulting multiple free AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity) before generating the PRD catches 80% of tech stack mistakes early. Each AI has different strengths - Claude for architecture, ChatGPT for general advice, Grok for alternatives, Perplexity for research-backed validation. Spending 15-20 minutes on this step prevents days of rework.
