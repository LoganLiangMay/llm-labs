# Agentic Coding Vault

A structured Obsidian + GitHub vault documenting my **AI / agentic coding workflows**, tools, and experiments.

## 🧠 Purpose
To keep track of:
- Current AI workflows I'm testing
- Tools and integrations (e.g. Context7, BMAT, Claude Code)
- Resources I've explored or implemented
- Prompts, drafts, and experiments
- Lessons and insights learned
