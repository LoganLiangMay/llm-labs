# Stack Validation Prompt Template
_Last updated: 2025-10-30_

## Purpose
Reusable prompt for validating tech stack decisions across multiple AI models before committing to a full PRD. Use this to catch potential issues early and gain confidence in your technology choices.

## When to Use
- After you've researched 2-3 potential tech stacks
- Before generating a full PRD
- When you're unsure about performance/scaling implications
- When you want multiple perspectives on your approach
- Before investing days of development time

## Which AI Tools to Use

### Recommended: Consult 2-3 of These (All Free Tiers)

| AI Tool | Best For | Free Tier | Access |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **ChatGPT** | General tech advice, common patterns | Yes (GPT-3.5) | chat.openai.com |
| **Claude.ai** | Architectural discussion, detailed analysis | Yes (limited) | claude.ai |
| **Grok** | Alternative perspectives, contrarian views | Yes (with X Premium) | x.com |
| **Perplexity** | Research-backed validation, citations | Yes | perplexity.ai |
| **Gemini** | Google ecosystem, Android/Firebase advice | Yes | gemini.google.com |

### Strategy:
- **Always use**: ChatGPT (fast, general) + Claude (thorough, architectural)
- **Add one**: Grok (alternatives), Perplexity (research), or Gemini (if using Google stack)

## Specific Questions I Need Help With

Please address these questions in your response:

### 1. Tech Stack Comparison
- Which stack is better suited for my MVP timeline and requirements?
- What are the deal-breakers or show-stoppers with each option?

### 2. Performance & Scalability
- How will each stack handle [specific requirement, e.g., "real-time messaging with 50+ users"]?
- What performance bottlenecks should I anticipate?
- Are there scaling issues that will hit me early?

### 3. Development Velocity
- Which stack will let me ship MVP fastest given my timeline?
- What's the learning curve if I'm not familiar with these technologies?
- Where will I get stuck or spend the most time?

### 4. Cost Implications
- What are the ongoing costs with each stack (APIs, hosting, third-party services)?
- Are there free tier limits I'll hit quickly?
- Any hidden costs I'm not seeing?

### 5. Risk Assessment
- What could go wrong with each approach?
- What am I overlooking or underestimating?
- Are there better alternatives I haven't considered?

### 6. MVP Scope Reality Check
- Is my MVP scope realistic for the timeline with each stack?
- What features should I cut to make the deadline?
- What's the absolute minimum viable version?

---

## My Context

**My Experience Level**:
[e.g., "Senior engineer with 5 years React, but new to mobile development"]

**What I'm Most Worried About**:
[e.g., "Real-time sync reliability under poor network conditions"]

**What I'm Most Excited About**:
[e.g., "Building cross-platform from a single codebase"]

**Constraints**:
[e.g., "Must support offline mode", "Budget: $50/month", "Solo developer"]

---

## What I Need from You

Please provide:

1. **Recommendation**: Which stack should I choose and why?
2. **Key Risks**: Top 3 risks with your recommended stack
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: How to address those risks
4. **MVP Scope Advice**: What to cut or keep for my timeline
5. **Alternatives**: Any better options I haven't considered?
6. **Next Steps**: What should I research or prototype first?

Be honest about tradeoffs and realistic about timelines. I'd rather hear hard truths now than discover problems mid-development.
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Split opinions**: Dig deeper into why they disagree
- üö® **Common risks**: If all AIs flag the same issue, take it seriously
- üí° **New options**: Did any AI suggest something you hadn't considered?

### Step 5: Document & Proceed

1. Save your validation notes in `/ai-drafts/`
2. Update your project context with the chosen stack
3. Proceed to Step 4: Generate PRD with confidence

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
‚ùå "I need real-time features"
‚úÖ "I need 50+ users to see message updates within 500ms, even on 3G networks"

### Provide Context
- Your experience level matters (affects "development velocity" advice)
- Budget constraints (free tiers vs. paid services)
- Solo vs. team project (different considerations)

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

After getting initial responses, ask:
```markdown
"You recommended [Stack A]. But I'm concerned about [specific issue].
How would you address that? Does that change your recommendation?"
```

### Challenge Recommendations

```markdown
"Most tutorials I've seen use [Stack B] for this use case.
Why are you suggesting [Stack A] instead? What am I missing?"
```

### Compare to Real-World Examples

```markdown
"WhatsApp was originally built with [Stack]. How does your recommendation
compare to that approach for a messaging app?"
```

- Real-time data handling

**Key question**: "How will [stack] handle [specific performance requirement]?"

### Scenario 3: Budget-Constrained
**Focus your questions on**:
- Free tier limits
- API costs at scale
- Hidden expenses

**Key question**: "What will this cost at [X users/requests] per month?"

### Scenario 4: New Technology for You
**Focus your questions on**:
- Learning resources
- Common pitfalls
- Development time with learning curve

**Key question**: "If I'm new to [technology], how much overhead does that add?"
