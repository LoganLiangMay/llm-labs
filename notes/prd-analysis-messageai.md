# PRD Analysis: MessageAI Example
_Last updated: 2025-10-30_

## Context
Analysis of the MessageAI PRD to extract best practices and learnings for future PRD generation.

## What Makes This PRD Excellent

### 1. **Clear MVP Definition with Hard Gates**
**Pattern**: The PRD explicitly defines 10 "hard requirements" that MUST be met for MVP

**Why it works**:
- No ambiguity about what's required
- Easy to validate completion (checkbox style)
- Prevents scope creep

**Example**:
```
### 3.1 Hard Requirements (Must-Have)
These 10 features are **mandatory** for MVP checkpoint:
1. One-on-One Chat Functionality
2. Real-Time Message Delivery (2+ Users)
... [with detailed descriptions]
```

**Lesson**: Always have numbered, mandatory requirements with clear acceptance criteria

---

### 2. **Comprehensive "Out of Scope" Section**
**Pattern**: Explicit list of what's NOT being built

**Why it works**:
- Prevents feature requests during development
- Sets clear expectations
- Organized by category (AI Features, Advanced Features, Deployment)

**Lesson**: Be ruthless about what's excluded. Document it prominently.

---

### 3. **Tech Stack with "Pros & Pitfalls" Analysis**
**Pattern**: For each technology, document:
- ✅ Advantages
- ⚠️ Pitfalls & Mitigations

**Example**:
```markdown
### 5.2 Expo SQLite: Pros & Pitfalls

**✅ Advantages**:
- Offline-First: Works perfectly for local message persistence
- Performance: Fast for local reads/writes

**⚠️ Pitfalls & Mitigations**:
1. **Schema Migrations**
   - Issue: No built-in migration system
   - Mitigation: Implement version tracking...
```

**Why it works**:
- Shows you've thought through risks
- Provides actionable mitigations
- Prevents surprises during implementation

**Lesson**: Don't just list tech choices. Explain risks and how to handle them.

---

### 4. **Testing Scenarios as Requirements**
**Pattern**: Concrete test cases that define success

**Example**:
```markdown
### 3.3 MVP Testing Scenarios
1. Real-time messaging: Two devices exchange messages with < 2s latency
2. Offline handling: Device goes offline, receives messages, comes back online
3. Persistence test: App force-quit and reopened shows complete chat history
```

**Why it works**:
- Makes "working" measurable
- Doubles as QA checklist
- Specific scenarios prevent vague "it works" claims

**Lesson**: Turn requirements into testable scenarios with specific conditions

---

### 5. **Open Questions Section**
**Pattern**: End with questions that need answers before implementation

**Why it works**:
- Identifies decision points upfront
- Provides recommendations (shows expertise)
- Forces clarification before coding

**Example**:
```markdown
## 13. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Physical Device Availability**:
   - Do you have access to physical iOS device?
   - Recommendation: Focus Android if not available
```

**Lesson**: Don't guess. Ask explicitly. Provide recommendations to guide decisions.

---

### 6. **User Stories with Acceptance Criteria**
**Pattern**: 30 user stories, each following "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"

**Why it works**:
- Covers all user types (sender, receiver, group member)
- Clear benefit statement (the "why")
- Organized by feature category

**Lesson**: Comprehensive user stories prevent missing edge cases

---

### 7. **Architecture Decisions with Code Patterns**
**Pattern**: Not just "what" but "how" with pseudo-code

**Example**:
```javascript
class MessageQueue {
  async sendMessage(message) {
    // 1. Save to SQLite with status='pending'
    // 2. Show in UI immediately
    // 3. Attempt Firebase sync
    // 4. Keep in queue for retry
  }
}
```

**Why it works**:
- Concrete implementation guidance
- Shows architectural thinking
- Prevents common mistakes

**Lesson**: Include code patterns for critical architectural decisions

---

### 8. **Risk Analysis with Impact & Mitigation**
**Pattern**: For each major risk:
- Description of risk
- Why it's a problem
- How to mitigate
- Fallback plan

**Example**:
```markdown
### Risk 4: Time Constraints
**Risk**: 24 hours is aggressive for a full messaging app.

**Mitigation**:
- Stick ruthlessly to MVP scope
- Use Firebase templates for faster setup
- Skip non-critical features if time runs short
- Priority order: 1-on-1 chat > offline > group > notifications
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges reality (tight timeline)
- Provides priority ordering
- Gives permission to cut scope

**Lesson**: Be honest about risks and have backup plans

---

### 9. **Success Metrics Section**
**Pattern**: Clear definition of "done" with checklist

**Why it works**:
- Measurable completion criteria
- Functional + non-functional requirements
- Acceptable limitations documented

**Example**:
```markdown
**Acceptable Limitations for MVP**:
- Basic UI (functional over beautiful)
- Foreground-only notifications
- Limited error handling polish
```

**Lesson**: Define both what must work AND what's acceptable to skip

---

### 10. **Build Order (Vertical Slicing)**
**Pattern**: Hour-by-hour breakdown of development

**Why it works**:
- Shows realistic timeline
- Emphasizes completing features fully before moving on
- Critical insight: "Build vertically—complete one-on-one chat fully before touching group chat"

**Lesson**: Time-box development and sequence features logically

---

## PRD Structure That Works

```markdown
1. Executive Summary (The "Why" and timeline)
2. User Stories (30+ covering all flows)
3. MVP Feature Requirements
   - Hard Requirements (10 mandatory)
   - Additional Features
   - Testing Scenarios
4. Tech Stack (with pros/pitfalls for each)
5. Technical Architecture & Considerations (deep dive)
6. Out of Scope (extensive, organized by category)
7. MVP Success Metrics (measurable criteria)
8. Post-MVP Roadmap (future phases)
9. Development Strategy (build order, vertical slicing)
10. Key Risks & Mitigation (5 major risks)
11. Technical Decisions Summary (patterns and rationale)
12. Dependencies & Setup (accounts, environment, libraries)
13. Open Questions & Decisions Needed
14. Success Criteria Checklist (copy-paste ready)
15. Notes for Reviewer (context and philosophy)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Based on what this PRD does well, avoid:

❌ **Vague MVP definition**
- Bad: "Messaging should work"
- Good: "Two devices exchange messages with < 2s latency"

❌ **Missing "Out of Scope" section**
- Leads to scope creep and misaligned expectations

❌ **Tech stack without risk analysis**
- Just listing technologies doesn't show understanding

❌ **No testing scenarios**
- Can't validate "done" without concrete test cases

❌ **Ignoring timeline constraints**
- 24-hour MVP needs explicit prioritization

❌ **No open questions**
- Guessing answers wastes time during implementation

---
