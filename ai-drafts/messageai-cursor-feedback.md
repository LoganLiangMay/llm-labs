# MessageAI - Cursor Implementation Feedback
_Date: 2025-10-30_

## PRD Review Complete - Answers to Open Questions

I've reviewed your PRD and here are my answers to the clarification questions:

### 1. Physical Device Availability ‚úÖ
**Answer**: Yes, I have iPhone and iPad available for Expo Go testing
**Impact**: Full iOS testing possible, including push notifications on physical devices

### 2. Firebase Project ‚úÖ
**Answer**: Create new Firebase project (I have an account). Free tier for now, can upgrade if needed.
**Action**: Set up new Firebase project during implementation

### 3. Image Support in MVP ‚úÖ
**Answer**: Include basic image sending in MVP (camera roll selection)
**Scope Addition**: Implement image picker, image upload to Firebase Storage, image display in chat

### 4. Group Chat Scope üìù EXPANDED
**Answer**: Beyond your recommendations - also add:
- Admin controls
- Member management (add/remove participants)
- Group editing (name, picture)

**Note**: This expands MVP scope. May impact 24-hour timeline. Consider prioritizing:
- P0 (Must-have): Group creation, messaging, participant list
- P1 (Important): Admin designation, member management
- P2 (Nice-to-have): Group editing if time permits

### 5. Deployment Target ‚úÖ
**Answer**: Expo Go as primary testing platform. iOS simulator testing post-MVP.
**Strategy**: Focus on Expo Go for rapid iteration, Xcode simulator for final validation

## Feedback for Implementation

### Timeline Reality Check
With the added scope (images + expanded group features), the 24-hour MVP may be tight. Suggested prioritization:

**Critical Path (24 hours)**:
1. Auth + Basic messaging (6 hours)
2. Offline sync + persistence (4 hours)
3. Group chat basics (4 hours)
4. Images (3 hours)
5. Admin controls (2 hours)
6. Testing + fixes (5 hours)

**If Time Runs Short, Defer**:
- Member management UI (can add post-MVP)
- Group editing (can add post-MVP)
- Keep admin designation but simplify UI

### Implementation Notes

**Firebase Storage for Images**:
- Set up Firebase Storage bucket
- Implement image upload with progress
- Generate thumbnails if time permits
- Store image URLs in Firestore messages

**Admin Controls**:
- Add `admins: array<userId>` to chat document
- Only admins can: add/remove members, edit group info
- Simple UI: long-press participant ‚Üí remove (if admin)

**Testing Priority**:
- Physical device testing for notifications (you have iPhone/iPad ‚úÖ)
- Expo Go for rapid development
- Test image upload on multiple devices (data usage consideration)

## Questions for You

Before I start implementing, please clarify:

1. **Image Size Limits**: Should we compress images before upload, or send full resolution?
   - Recommendation: Compress to max 1024px width for MVP

2. **Group Chat Limits**: Maximum participants per group?
   - Recommendation: 20 for MVP (keeps UI simple, reduces Firestore reads)

3. **Admin Auto-Assignment**: Should group creator be auto-admin?
   - Recommendation: Yes, creator = first admin

4. **Offline Image Handling**: Queue image uploads when offline?
   - Recommendation: Yes, but show "uploading..." state clearly

## Ready to Implement?

Once you confirm the questions above (or accept recommendations), I'm ready to start building.

**Next Steps**:
1. Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
2. Set up Firebase project and config
3. Start with auth flow
4. Build messaging infrastructure
5. Add image support
6. Implement group features
7. Test on your iPhone/iPad via Expo Go

Let me know if you want to proceed with recommendations or need to adjust anything!
